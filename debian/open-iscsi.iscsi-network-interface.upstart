# iscsi-network-interface - suppress configuration of network interface used
# by iSCSI root device
#
# If the root filesystem is on iSCSI, then we must take care to avoid
# changing the state of its network interface. To this end, the initramfs
# leaves a note for us which interface was used, and we mangle
# /run/network/ifstate manually to stop it being brought up or down
# automatically. This is a slight layering violation, but, unfortunately,
# ifupdown appears to have no way to do this without also running
# /etc/network/*.d/ scripts.
